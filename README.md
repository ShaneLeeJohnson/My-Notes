## Usage

To use this application you can visit the following link: https://hidden-shore-05608-dd7b3522ae89.herokuapp.com/

When the user first visits the my notes webpage they are taken to the Note Taker landing page. Once they click on the get started button they will be taken to the /notes page where they will see any existing notes that they have created. The user can then either create a new note, click on an exisiting note to view or edit it, or delete any existing note by clicking on the red trash can icon. To save a new note the user can click on the new note button that appears when viewing an existing note or start typing in the note title section on the right hand side of the screen. Once a user has titled their note and written some text in the note text portion they can click on the save note button and will see their new note on the left hand side of the screen. The data is stored on a server so the user will be able to access all of their notes from any of their devices.
